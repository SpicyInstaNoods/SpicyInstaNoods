- 👋 I have carbs in my name so there you go bon appetit.
- 👀 Tryna get into webdev, but still taking my baby steps at algorithms and data structures.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how not to write bad code.
- 💞️ I’m NOT looking to collaborate and will not be willing to collaborate unless someone is super good and explains me everything.
- 📫 How to reach me: really. Why would anyone even read this line. I'm simply a stranger, why even contact me?
